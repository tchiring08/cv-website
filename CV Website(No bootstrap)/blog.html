        	<span id="more2"> - Having access to information: Now we have access to almost all information on the internet due to technology. All we have to is google search on the web. <br>

          - Online classes: The benefits of online classes are sometime we cannot attend classes due to sickness or emergency and might have missed important content or sometime we might have forgotten content of the course. At that very point online classes help us access through lectures and course materials. <br>

          - Handing Assignment Online: In the past we had to submit our assignment in hardcopies, which basically means printing all those never ending reports that we wrote overnight. But now due to technology advancement we submit our assignment in soft copies through online classroom.<br>

          Educations and technology may not always have positive reactions because after all we are humans and we tend to misuse it. But having said that technology impacts educations in all the better way.
